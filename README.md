# Multi-channel proxy client's browser framework
Similar to Edge and Chrome's Tab page, it supports dragging pages in and out. This Tab  source code is extracted from KiroSoft's <a href="https://www.tradesir.com/help/en/index.htm"> Multi-channel proxy client </a>  project.

Multi-channel proxy client is an excellent multi-channel proxy and IP rotation tool.
